> Rock Paper Scissors with Unreal Engine? Sounds like an overkill - Here we go!

## Overview
This is a project I built to practice **UE Sessions** and **Online Subsystem Steam (OSS)** in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints. It was quite a journey, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot along the way. Feel free to check it out and explore the features!

## Features
- **Classic Rock Paper Scissors Gameplay**: A simple and familiar game with a modern twist.
- **Multiplayer via Steam**: Challenge your friends in a 1 vs 1 match through Steam. <br/>

- **Lobby Overhaul**: Intuitive lobby system for a seamless multiplayer experience.

## Note from the Author
This build is published as a **Debug Game** build since this is a non-commercial project created for study purposes. The game does not have a unique **Steam App ID**, which prevents it from running as intended in a shipping build. To enable Steam functionality, the default **Steam test App ID** was used.
